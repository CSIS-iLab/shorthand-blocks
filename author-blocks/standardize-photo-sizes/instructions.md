# What is this
These are CSS settings that can be used to standardize the size of photos in a Shorthand `Grid Section` if you are using it as an author block. Non-standard photo sizes is a good reason to use a Shorthand `Grid Section`, as well as having an odd-number of authors, since Shorthand takes care of all responsiveness for you.

## In the Shorthand editor
Add your photos and text as needed. You'll see in the example, the middle photo is shorter than the photos on the left and right. Copy the settings from `style.css` into the CSS for your Shorthand story (remember to adjust the section ID to match the section you're working on).

## Result
Here, all the photos are the same shape. However, the tops of the left and middle photos are cut off a little -- this is another reason to start with photos the same size if you can. The original design called for a color overlay on hover, shown here in blue. This can be deleted from the CSS if you don't need it.
